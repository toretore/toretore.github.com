* In a few years, almost all cars sold will be at least hybrid electric
* Let's say an average 20 KWh battery, giving ~100 Km range
* Most people drive shorter than this on a daily basis
* Result: Petrol consumption will fall drastically
  * Demand for petrol falls drastically
  * Petrol stations will struggle to survive, they will disappear from towns and cities and be sustainable only between cities for long-distance driving
  * Convenience of petrol goes down
    * Cost of petrol goes up (?)
    * Electricity is much, much cheaper, and the difference keeps getting larger
    * People get used to having "full tank" every morning, going increasingly out of their way to find expensive petrol becomes burdensome
  * ICEs will soon be seen as inconvenient, dirty, noisy, polluting relics of the past
  * Battery technology continues to develop until it is unambiguously a vastly better choice than ICE
  * Most new cars will from then on be pure battery electric; the market demands it and economies of scale will set in for real
