 <ul>
   <li>In a few years, almost all cars sold will be at least hybrid electric</li>
   <li>Let's say an average 20 KWh battery, giving ~100 Km range</li>
   <li>Most people drive shorter than this on a daily basis</li>
   <li>Result: Petrol consumption will fall drastically
     <ul>
       <li>Demand for petrol falls drastically</li>
       <li>Petrol stations will struggle to survive, they will disappear from towns and cities and be sustainable only between cities for long-distance driving</li>
       <li>Convenience of petrol goes down
         <ul>
           <li>Cost of petrol goes up (?)</li>
           <li>Electricity is much, much cheaper, and the difference keeps getting larger</li>
           <li>People get used to having "full tank" every morning, going increasingly out of their way to find expensive petrol becomes burdensome</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>ICEs will soon be seen as inconvenient, dirty, noisy, polluting relics of the past</li>
       <li>Battery technology continues to develop until it is unambiguously a vastly better choice than ICE</li>
       <li>Most new cars will from then on be pure battery electric; the market demands it and economies of scale will set in for real</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
 </ul>
